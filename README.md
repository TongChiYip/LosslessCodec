The usage was given in [LosslessCodec.ipynb](https://github.com/TongChiYip/LosslessCodec/LosslessCodec.ipynb). So sorry that I've got no time to translate the whole notebook file into English, but I think the code was written as simple and elegant as I can, so hopefully you can understand how to use my code even you are not good at Chinese.
